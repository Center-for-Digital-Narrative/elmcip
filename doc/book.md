## Events
Info about events.

### Events
Events refer to a happening or an occurrence, typically one planned by an organization, that is related to the field of electronic literature. Examples of events documented in the ELMCIP Knowledge Base include: awards, conferences, exhibitions, festivals, performances, readings, seminars, and workshops.

The Event record specifies the type, date, and location of the event, as well as details about the organizer and URLs at which to access additional information about the event.

Once developed, the ideal event record should not only describe what took place and who or what works were presented there, but also provide a sense of the event's significance to the field of e-literature. An event's significance may be inferred through cross-references, such as the list of creative or critical works presented, but contributors are also encouraged to explicitly comment in the description about aspects of the event they and others regard(ed) as meaningful and/or significant.

What, for instance, did the event's organizers intend the event to achieve? Were there any noteworthy occurences or discernable trends at the event? Contributors documenting events are encouraged, for example, to note things such as: the debut of a major work at an exhibition, the dissemination of a distinctive theoretical position or critical argument at a conference, or the proliferation of works in a particular genre, modality or platform at a festival.

However speculative and subjective, these notes will help document the contemporary field and, in the process, inform the writing of future literary histories of electronic literature.

### Description (Event)
The "Description (Event)" page asks for just two pieces of information, a short description of the event and tags that help to describe the event.

Short description: Provide a brief description of the event, one that provides as much of the following information as possible: Who organized the event? What took place and where? When was the event held? Why is the event relevant to the e-literary field? How did it make an intervention into its present situation? How was the event received, by participants and others? Will it likely be remembered as a significant event in e-literary history?

Much of the basic factual information information can likely be found on the event's website, perhaps in the call for works and papers or promotional about pages. If you cite directly from these materials, cite it as follows:

(Source: Event website.)

Evaluative remarks about the event's reception, relevance and significance will, obviously, require additional research and critical judgment. Indentify the sources, including oneself, of these evaluations like this:

(Source: Author's name.)

Tags: A comma-separated list of terms, keywords, or phrases that describe and/or contextualize this event. For example: electronic literature, net art, interactive fiction, sonic art, animations, digital poetics, affordances, constraints, juried show, online exhibition, reading, literary, locative media, remediation, obsolescence,  gallery, scholary.

After this page, proceed to the "Event Documentation."

### Event Information
On the Event Information page, contributors enter the following basic information about the event: its name, the event type, the date(s) on which it took place, the primary organizer and its email address, the location, URLs where additional information about the event can be accessed, and associated events.

These fields are fairly self-explanatory, but here are a few guidelines.

Name of event: Enter the official name of the event in a way that will make it searchable to users who may be new to the field.

This often, but not always, means spelling out acronymns. For example: Digital Arts and Culture 1998 Conference instead of DAC '98.

However, some events are organized by organizations with long titles that are not usually spelled out. For example: ELMCIP Seminar on Electronic Literature Communities rather than Electronic Literature as a Model of Creativity and innovation in Practice Seminar on Electronic Literature Communities.

Moreover, organizers often refer to an event in several different ways on their websites, catalogs and other documents. You can note the various names in the description. Do your best to select and enter the name that seems most representative and official. If you're completely stumped, consider emailing the ELMCIP Knowledge Base Editor, kb_editor [at] elmcip.net for advice and/or contacting someone involved with organizing the event.

Event type: Select one or more of the categories listed.

Date: The format is year-month-day. If the event lasts more than one day, enter the end date as well.

Organizer: Enter the name of the organization that arranged the event. If this field does not autocomplete, add the organization by clicking on the link, which will enable you to create a new node record. Even if the field doesn't autocomplete, it's a good idea to scan the list of organizations to see if the organization already has a node record, perhaps with a name slightly different than the one you just typed in the box. This step prevents creating a duplicate entry.

Email: Add the email for the event's primary organizer.

Location: Enter information about the primary locale where the event was held. This information can typically be found on the official webpages for the event.

URL: Enter the title of the event's webpage and URLs for its most important page(s), typically the home and/or about pages.

Archive URL:  If information about the event is available at a web-based archive, such as the Internet Archive, or a university open-research archive, enter the URL here.

Associated with another event:  If this event is associated with another event (for instance a night of readings presented at a conference), link to that event here. The event will autocomplete if it is database. If it is not, first add the event, taking care to check that it is not already listed under a slightly different name.

After completing the "Event Information" page, you can proceed to the "Description" screen for the Event, which can be accessed in the left-hand column of the page, just under "Event Information."

### Event Documentation
On this page contributors can upload and attach materials that will help to document the event. At present, contributors can submit three basic types of content: files, images, and multimedia.

1. Files: Attach relevant files from the event, such as .pdfs of printed program or posters, or audio recordings in mp3 format. These must be less than 120 MB. Allowed file types: txt jpg jpeg mp3 pdf png

2. Images: You may upload and attach individual images (20MB max) documenting the event here.
Note: Use multimedia field to link flickr sets or video.

3. Multimedia: Use this field to display Vimeo and YouTube videos, and other multimedia content.
Note: flickr photo sets are not currently working with this field. We are waiting for an update to the module, so please wait until the issue is resolved before adding them.

## Creative Works
Typically, creative works refer to born-digital literary artifacts, works of electronic literature and digital literary art. In special instances print-based texts that have been deemed significant to the field of electronic literature are also included. Mark Z. Danielewskiâ€™s House of Leaves appears, for instance, because of the attention N. Katherine Hayles gives to this print novel in her book Electronic Literature: New Horizons for the Literary. Users entering data about creative works will do so on three screens: Core Information, Description, and Documentation.

### Documentation (Creative Works)
Info here. Is the bloody spacing working?

### Description (Creative Work)
On the Description page users enter a range of information about the form and content of the creative work. Several of these fields are cross-referenced and searchable in the Knowledge Base.

Tags: A comma-separated list of terms, keywords, or phrases that describe and/or contextualize the creative work.

Typically, these will be technical terms from literary studies (defamiliarization, bildungsroman, sonnet), philosophy and critical theory (ideology, sublime, phenomenology), art history (iconography, abstract expressionism, Dada), computer science (JavaScript, DHTML, interface) media studies (redundancy) and other fields, like game studies (cybertext), affiliated with the field of electronic literature.

For example, here are tags applied to the hypertext novel The Unknown: collaboration, comedy, hypertext, hypertext fiction, network fiction, parody, pastiche, picaresque, satire, narrative, drug literature, pharmakon, mockumentary

For most tags use all lower-case letters, unless the tag is a proper noun or name (Paris, Borges, University of Bergen), an adjective derived from a proper name (Marxist, Kafkaesque, Borgesian), an acronynm (DHTML). For specifics about capitalization, consult the Chicago Manual of Style. As you begin to type, the field begins to autocomplete with lists of tags already used in the Knowledge Base.

Description (in English): Provide a brief description of the work in English, up to 350 words.

Description (in original language): If the work was not written in English, write short description, fewer than 350 words, in the original language. Leave this field empty if the original language of the work is English.

Langague of abstract: Select the human language for the "Description (in original language).

Language of description (Taxonomy): g

Other language version: If there is version of this creative work in the knowledge base published in another language, link to it here. If the work is not in the knowledge base, click the link and add the work.

Other edition: If there is a record for another edition of this work in the same language in the knowledge base, enter it here. The form will autocomplete.

Pull quotes: Enter a significant passage (1-3 sentences) excerpted from the text that will help to contextualize it. The quote may displayed on the Knowledge Base and should be representative of the text, so as to entice readers to access and read the work.

When entering a pull quote, there is no need to include quotation marks identifying it as cited material.

Technical notes: Enter relevant notes about the platform, etc. used in the creation of the work, and in particular any plug-ins or other information required for the user to access the work.

Appears in: If the work was published in an anthology, collection, or special issue of a journal link to it here using the autocomplete field. If the field does not complete, click the "add the anthology" link, which will open up a window to add a new Critical Writing node record.

Event: List the event(s) where the work has been presented. If an event is missing from the list follow the link to add a new node record.

### Core Information (Creative Work)
This page collects basic bibliographic data about the creative work. You do not need to enter information for all fields as some will not necessarily apply, but please be as thorough as possible. The work's title, obviously, is essential. Author, year, Publication venue, and URL are also all very important, as they make it easier for the ELMCIP editorial team to track down data for "stub entries."

Since there are quite a few fields to complete, users are advised to save regularly. The save button is at the bottom of the page.

If you are cutting and pasting text from a Microsoft Word document, please first paste the text into a plain text editor and copy it again before pasting it into the Knowledge Base, to avoid Word-specific formatting codes.

Title: Enter the full title of the work, using the characters and capitalization style that best represent the work's original title, as designated by its author(s).

Although most of the entries in the Knowledge Base follow headline-style capitalization (e.g. The Breathing Wall, The End of Capitalism), a few follow sentence-style capitalization (To be or not to be Mouchette, What we has has not yet been).

The following titles (in italics) suggest how unconventional some e-lit titles can be and why it's important to pay close attention to the characters:

"Where you will have been I am..." [not yet found]
_cross.ova.ing ][4rm.blog.2.log][

If you're unsure about how to format the title, create the entry and email the editor (kb_editor [at] elmcip [dot] net) your question and a link to the URL in the Knowledge Base.

Author: Enter the name of the author. The author's name will autocomplete if it is in the database. If the author is not yet in the database, click "add the author," which will open up a "Create Person" page.

Contributor: If a person's role on the project is described in a way other than author or co-author (e.g. sound designer, illustrator, etc.) list the person here. If the contributor's name does not auto-complete, click the "add the contributor" link first, which will open up a "Create Person" page. Use the contributors note field to describe the different roles individuals played.

Contributors Note: Enter information about the different author/contributor roles in this field. This is where to credit, for example, composers, programmers, or other persons who contributed to the project but are not billed as authors.

Translator: If this work is a translation, please use this autocomplete field to indicate the translator. If the translator is not yet in the KB, click "add the translator" first.

Year: Enter the year in which the work was first published. If the work changed on an ongoing basis over time, indicate the full period of its composition in the work description.

Publisher: If the work was not self-published, enter the publisher (journal, publishing house, etc.) or organization (organizer of conference or event, e.g. Electronic Literature Organization). The publisher or organization's name will autocomplete if it is in the database. If it does not autocomplete, click "add the publisher" or "add the organization" and create node records.

Publication Venue: Indicate the sites at which the work was published or formally presented. Multiple selections from the menu are permitted, as online literary works are often published simultaneously on the author's personal site and in other Web venues, such as online journals and gallerys.

Most publication venues are listed in the menu, but if none seem applicable, choose "Other."

URL: Enter the link title in the left box (the limt is 128 characters) and the URL (universal resource locator) in the right box. To avoid transcription errors, we recommend copying and pasting the URL's specific character string.

Download URL: Enter a URL where the entire work or source files may be downloaded, if applicable.

Archive URL: If the work is available at a web-based archive, such as the Internet Archive, or a university open-research archive, link here.

WorldCat Permalink: If there is a record for this work in the WorldCat library catalog, enter the Permalink here. Please indicate the year of publication in the title field of the URL (e.g. 1996. ed.) Multiple entries are allowed.

To determine if the work is catalogued in WorldCat, go to www.worldcat.org and search the database.

ISBN: The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a unique numeric identifier assigned to each addition and variation of published books, including electronic books. You can find the ISBN next to the bar code on a book's jacket and on the copyright page. Enter the ISBN-13 (preferred) or ISBN-10, including hyphens. If a book is published in hardcover and paperback editions, enter the hardcover edition first

Language: Select the human language the work was written in. Select more than one (e.g. Norwegian and English and Slovene) if the work includes multiple languages.Note: this is a taxonomy field, which will replace the previous Language field, which will be deleted once the data is migrated from it. For new records, disregard the other Language field above and use this one.

License: If the copyright assigned to the work is known, select it here.

After completing this page, proceed to the Description.

## Organizations
Organziations refer to institutional entities in which groups of persons collaborate for some end related to the field of electronic literature.

Examples of organizations documented in the ELMCIP Knowlege Base include: nonprofit organizations, arts organizations, research groups, academic consortia, academic departments, academic programs, etc. The Events record includes a description, the location, and contact information about the organization.

Note: Journals and presses are listed as Publishers, not as Organizations.

Users enter data about Events on two pages: Organization Information and Description.

### Organization Information
On the Organization Information page users enter basic data about the organization: its name, location, email address, and the URL for its website.

Name of Organization: Enter the full, official name of the organization. In most cases, spell out any acronyms.

If an organization is regularly referred to by its acronym, you can indicate this in the description. For instance, the entry on the Electronic Literature Organization makes clear that the non-profit group is commonly called the ELO.

When entering the name of the organization, be as specific as possible when it is a smaller organization embedded within a larger institution. A single university may host several organizations active in the e-literary field. Each organization may warrant a separate node record.

The Univeristy of Bergen (where the research team responsible for building and editing the ELMCIP Knowledge Base is based), for example, hosts or has hosted several organizations that have contributed to the development of the field of electronic literature. These organizations include departments, programs, and research groups. Therefore, the University of Bergen appears in several entries: Electronic Literature Research Group, University of Bergen; University of Bergen, Department of Humanistic Informatics; and Univeristy of Bergen, Program in Digital Culture.

Location name: Be as precise as you can, but at the very least add the city and country. A "contact" link on the organizatin's webpage may provide the information you need.

Email: In most cases, the email address to enter here will be found by following a "contact" link on the organization's webpage.

URL: Add the title and the homepage for the organization.

### Description (Organization)
This page has just two components: a short description and an "add a new file" option.

Short description: Provide a brief statement about the organization that makes clear its purpose and explains its relevance to the field of electronic literature. In most cases, this entry will be between 100-300 words.

You can often glean most of the information about an organization's mission in the "about" section of its website, which may also provide a brief history. If citing this material, list it as follows: (Source: Organization's website.)

Add a new file: Here you can attach files (txt pdf ppt zip), such as an annual report, with additional information about the organization.

## Critical Writing
Critical writing includes monographs, book chapters, journal articles, reviews etc. written about electronic literature.

The title should be the title of the specific work described in the record (e.g. the title of an article if the record is for an article in a journal or a book). If you are creating a record for a chapter or article published in a book, first create the record for the book before creating the specific record for the article.

Users will enter data about the piece of critical writing on four screens, described below: Core Information, Book or Journal Information, Description, and References and Attachments.

### Description (Critical Writing)
On this page you will enter descriptive information that will provide other users a sense of what a work of critical writing is about and contextualize it within the larger field of electronic literature and the digital literary arts.

Tags: A comma-separated list of terms, keywords, or phrases that describe and/or contextualize this piece of critical writing. Some tags may be similar to the subject headings assigned by librarians. Examples: digital poetry -- history and criticism, digital poetics, procedural poetics, generative, intentionality, materiality.

How can I come up with tags? Reading the work closely, of course, is the best way to come up with tags. But it is also possible through a more extensive, surface, reading of the text in which you're searching for keywords that help to describe the text. Often, you will find them embedded in the title of a work, in the jacket copy, or, in the case of a journal article, in the abstract.

Take Espen Aarseth's book Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, for instance. The book's title and sub-title contains several tags: (cybertext, ergodic, ergodic literature). Scanning the back-cover copy suggests many more: literary theory, computer games, digital literature, cyborg textuality, hypertext fiction, computer-generated poetry, collaborative, narrative theory, semiotics, rhetoric. And the Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data, which in the 1997 paperback edition is on book's final page, provides a few more possibilites: discourse analysis, literature and technology, communication and technology.

As you begin entering your tags, the database will suggest other terms that other users have added. These suggestions are based on the characters that you type, so they may or may not apply to the work you're describing. It's usually worth scanning the list, however, as you may get new ideas, not just about what tags to apply but how this work relates to other materials in the Knowlege Base.

Abstract (in English): Enter a brief descriptive abstract describing the critical writing or article in fewer than 350 words. Ideally, the abstract should summarize the piece in a way that provides readers' a sense of what the work is about.

It is fine to cite abstracts and text from other sources. Many of the entries for books, for example, have the publisher's catalog descriptions. Just be sure to credit the source at the end of the entry. For example:

(Source: Continuum online catalog.)

(Source: Author's abstract.)

Contributors to the Knowledge Base are encouraged to revise and elaborate upon existing abstracts, much as contributors to wiki websites do.

If your revisions to an existing description are substantive and, in your judgment, significantly alter its content please explain your changes in the "revision log message," which can be accessed by clicking on the "Revision information" in the left column.

Abstract (in original language): If the work is not written in English write an abstract of fewer than 350 words in its original language of publication. Leave this field empty if the language of the work is English.

Language of abstract: If you entered an abstract for a non-English-language work, select the language in which it was originally written. If you are creating a new record, skip this field and proceed to the next, Language of abstract (Taxonomy).

Language of abstract (Taxonomy): Select the human language of the non-English-language work. Note: this taxonomy field will replace the previous Language of abstract field, which will be deleted once the data is migrated from it. For new records, disregard the other Language of abstract field above and use this one.

Other language version: If there is a record in the Knowledge Base of another version of this item published in a different language, add the reference here.

Pull quote: Enter a significant passage (1-2 sentences) excerpted from the text that will help to contextualize it. The quote may displayed on the Knowledge Base and should be representative of the text, pinpointing its primary claim(s) or identifying a key topic, so as to entice readers to access and read the work.

Do not put quotation marks around the pull quote.

### Core Information (Critical Writing)
On this page, enter basic bibliographic information about the critical work. Most of the fields should be fairly self-explanatory.

Work title: Enter the full title of the critical work. If the work has a sub-title, enter it after a colon (e.g. Electronic Literature: New Horizons for the Literary).

Although most of the entries in the Knowledge Base follow headline-style capitalization (e.g. Digital Art and Meaning), a few follow sentence-style capitalization (What we has has not yet been). You may choose either style.

Author: Enter the full name of the author, first (middle, if applicable) and last. The author's name will autocomplete if it is in the database. If the author is not yet in the database click "add the author" and create a new node record for the person.

Editor: Enter the full name of the editor, if applicable. The editor's name will autocomplete if it is in the database. If the author is not yet in the database, click "add the author" and create a new node record for the person.

Note: You only need to add the editor if you created a record for a text in which the editor is explicitly credited, such as an edited anthology, monograph or the special issue of a journal. If you are entering a single journal article or a chapter from an anthology, do not enter the editor of the volume here.

Year:  Enter the year the work was published.

Publication type: Select the publication type of this critical writing. Multiple selections may apply if the same item fits multiple categories (for example, a conference paper that is also published as a journal publication) but a specific single selection is usually adequate. Only select the term that describes the specific instance the record describes. For instance, a review is a review no matter where it is published. An article in a special issue of a print journal is an article in a print publication. The special issue as a whole that contains the article is the special issue, and has a separate record from the article itself.

Event: If the critical article was presented at a conference, select it from the list. The event will autocomplete if it is in the database. If it is not yet in the database, click "add the event."

Publisher: Enter the name of the publisher of a book, the title of a journal, or other publishing entity. The publisher's name will autocomplete if it is in the database. If the publisher is not yet in the database, click "add the publisher" and create a new node reference.

URL: Enter the link title in the left box (the limt is 128 characters) and the URL (universal resource locator) in the right box. To avoid transcription errors, we recommend copying and pasting the URL's specific character string.

Archive URL:  If the work is available at a web-based archive, such as the Internet Archive, or a university open-research archive, link here.

Language: Select the human language the work was written in. Select more than one (e.g. Norwegian and English and Slovene) if the work includes multiple languages. Each translated edition of the work should have a different node reference. Note: this is a taxonomy field, which will replace the previous Language field, which will be deleted once the data is migrated from it. For new records, disregard the other Language field above and use this one.

License: If the copyright assigned to the work is known, select it here.

### References and Attachments (Critical Writing)
On this page, you will enter information about other texts events referenced in the critical writing. These references will be linked to other nodes in the Knowledge Base, making visible relations within the e-literary field.

Info about References and Attachments (Critical Writing):

Creative works referenced: Enter the title of a work of electronic literature or digital literary art referenced in the critical writing. If the work is not already in the Knowledge Base, click on the link to create a new record for it.

Critical writing referenced:  If one work of critical writing references another in a substantial way (sustained critical engagement) cross-reference it here by entering the title in the autocomplete field. If it is not yet in the Knowledge Base, click the link to add the critical writing.

Event referenced: If the critical writing is about an event, such as a report on a conference or a review of a festival or exhibition, enter the event here. The field will autocomplete if the event is in the Knowledge Base, otherwise first click on the link to add the event.

Add image: Upload an image of the book cover or other image. Click the "Choose file" button and locate the file on your hard drive, then click "Upload." The file must be smaller than 120 MB. The follow file types are allowed: png, gif, jpg, jpeg.

Multimedia: Use this field to display Vimeo and YouTube videos, and other multimedia content. Note: flickr photo sets are not currently working with this field. We are waiting for an update to the module, so please wait until the issue is resolved before adding them.

Attach relevant files here: Use this field to upload the following type of files: txt, pdf, ppt, mp3, html, htm, rtf, pptx. You may want to upload full-text files of the critical writing, audio files of a conference session when the critical writing was discussed, or slides from a talk during which the critical writing was presented.

## Authors
Authors are people working in or around the field in the field of electronic literature. Each author has a "Person" record in the Knowledge Base. A developed person record includes the person's legal name, contact information, location, and basic biographical information.

The list of authors in the Electronic Literature Knowledge Base is fairly extensive, as the editorial team decided to take an expanded view of the author-function, one appropriate to a field characterized by an expanded definition of writing. Put simply, an author is person whose activities have contributed to the field of electronic literature, endowing them with some degree of authority.

Many authors in the Knowledge Base are writers of some sort: the artist-practitioners who compose creative works; the scholars, critics, and journalists who write critical works; the translators who translate texts from one language to another; or editors and publishers who edit and commission texts and administer the publications and sites where writing circulates. Other person records include: teachers of courses on electronic literature and officials at organizations.

When creating or revising a person record, you will typically be entering data on two types screens (listed in the left-hand column of the "Create Person" page): Basic Information and Biography.

### Basic Information (Author)
Basic Information is the first page of a person record and contains core data that helps to identify a specific person. Data entered on this page includes the person's full name, the name and URL of their websites, their email (not displayed publicly), their current location, and their primary nationality or passport country.

Information about these fields is provided below.

A person's name includes: First, middle (if known), and last names. Authors should use the name under which their work is usually published and catalogued.

First name: Given name (e.g. "Michael" in "Michael Joyce"). Enter the name that is typically attributed to them in bibliographic records. For example, "Joseph Tabbi" and not "Joe Tabbi."

Middle name: (optional, can also be an initial, e.g. "S." in "William S. Burroughs".)

Last name:  Family or surname of the person ("Joyce" in "Michael Joyce"). If the work is authored by a collective, enter the name of the group in the last name field (e.g. JODI), which will insure that it is alphabetized correctly.

Personal website: Enter the title and URL to sites or pages about or maintained by the author. An author might, for instance, maintain a personal website and, if they are affiliated with a university or an organization, also have webpages about them on the institution's website. The "Add another item" button allows users to enter multiple websties.

Author email: The person's email will not be displayed publicly. ELMCIP editors and administrators may use this email to communicate with authors about their records in the Knowledge Base.

KB User ID: If the author is a contributor to the ELMCIP Knowledge Base, enter the author's KB username here, usually a person's first and last name. The field will autocomplete. Identifying the KB user ID allows the system to display works entered by others on each individual author's profile page.

Please only enter the User ID if you are the author, or an editor of the KB.

There are two location fields for each person record, to indicate where the person currently resides (residency), and what country they are from (nationality).

Residency : Provide data about the person's primary place of work or residence. Only the country, city, and state will be publicly displayed.

Nationality: Choose the person's primary nationality, typically the country in which they currently hold a passport.

### Biography (Authors)
Biography is the second page of an Authors/Person record. Enter information here about a person's year of birth (and year of death, if applicable), an author photo (no larger than 400x400) and a short biography. This biographical profile should help situate the person within the field of electronic literature, typically by providing basic professional details that foreground their activities in and around the digital-literary arts. There is also an attachment field, which can be used to upload a CV or biographical materials in PDF format.

Author photo: Click "Choose File" to locate the image on your hard drive, then select "Upload." For the file to upload properly, it must meet the following specifications: it may be no larger than 400 x 400 pixels; it must be smaller than 120 MB, it must be one of the following file types: a png, gif, jpg, or jpeg file.

Short biography: Enter a biographical profie of the person. Again, it should include basic professional details that helps situate the person within the field of electronic literature. Select "Simple HTML" as the text format. If you copy the text, cite the source as follows: (Source: author's webpage).

Text format: Choose "Simple HTML."

Add a new file: Use this field to attach a text file or PDF document, such as a CV. Click "Choose File" to select a txt or PDF file from your hard drive, then select "Upload." The file must be less than 120 MB.

## Teaching Resources
Use this field to document pedagogic materials used to teach electronic literature and the digital literary arts. Examples of pedagogic materials include courses and course syllabi, lesson plans, exercises, video tutorials and lessons.

Add entries for the creative works and critical writings addressed in the teaching resources. These references will appear on the records for those items and indicate where and when they were taught.

Title of Resource: Enter the full title of the teaching resource. If the work has a sub-title, enter it after a colon.

Most entries in the Electronic Literature Knowledge Base follow headline-style capitalization (e.g. Digital Art and Meaning), some follow sentence-style capitaliztion (What we has has not yet been). You may choose either style.

If you are entering the name of a course, here is the recommended format:

Title of course: Subtitle (Course code/number, Semester Year).

Here are some examples of actual courses to use as models:

Digital Genres: Digital Art, Electronic Literature, and Computer Games (DIKULT 103, Spring 2011)

## Book or Journal Information
On this page enter bibliographic information about the work of critical writing. The fields on this page apply primarily to two publication types, books and journals. If you can't find all of the information, we understand; just be as thorough as possible.

ISBN: The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a numeric identifier assigned to each edition and variation of a book. Enter the ISBN-13 (preferred) or ISBN-10, including the hyphens (if printed with them). If a book is published in hardcover and paperback editions, enter the hardcover edition first. 

The ISBN is typically found on the copyright page and on the back cover or jacket of the book. You can also find the ISBN by looking up the book in WorldCat, a library catalog, or an online bookstore, such as Amazon.com

You will only enter an ISBN number for book. Journals have ISSN and/or e-ISSN numbers. See below for details.

WorldCat Permalink: If a record for this item is available on the WorldCat library database <http://www.worldcat.org/>, enter the Permalink in this field. Use the URL title field to indicate the edition year (e.g. 1996 ed.). Multiple entries are allowed. 

You will find the Permalink button at the top of the item's WorldCat record, to the right of the Cite/Export, Print, E-mail, and Share buttons. 

Edition: If this critical writing has been published in multiple editions, enter information about this edition here (e.g. 2nd ed.).
